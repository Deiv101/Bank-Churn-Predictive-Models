# Bank-Churn-Predictive-Modeling

  <center>What is Churn?</center>
  </center>
Defined loosely, churn is the process by which customers cease doing business with a company. In this particular project, bank churn is how many customers left our bank.

This can be measured based on actual usage or failure to renew (when the product is sold using a subscription model). Often evaluated for a specific period of time, there can be a monthly, quarterly, or annual churn rate.

When new customers begin buying and/or using a product, each new user contributes to a product’s growth rate. Inevitably some of those customers will eventually discontinue their usage or cancel their subscription; either because they switched to a competitor or alternative solution, no longer need to product’s functions, they’re unhappy with their user experience, or they can no longer afford or justify the cost. The customers that stop using/paying are the “churn” for a given period of time.

Why is churn prediction important?
Preventing a loss in profits is one clear motivation for reducing churn, but other subtleties may underlie a company’s quest to quell it. Most strikingly, the cost of customer acquisition usually starkly outweighs that of customer retention, so stamping out churn also compels from a more subtle financial perspective.

While churn presents an obvious difficulty to businesses, its remedy is not always immediately clear. In many cases, and without descriptive data, companies are at a loss as to what drives it. Luckily, machine learning provides effective methods for identifying churn’s underlying factors and proscriptive tools for addressing it.
